## Introduction

This Python script provides implementations for the following data structures and algorithms:

- Array operations: Adding data, linear search, binary search, sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, radix sort).
- Linked list operations: Adding and removing data.
- Queue operations: Enqueuing and dequeuing data.
- Stack operations: Pushing and popping data.
- Hash table operations: Inserting, retrieving, and deleting key-value pairs.
- Graph operations: Adding edges and displaying the adjacency matrix representation.

## Installation

To run the script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/amphitter/data-structures-and-algorithms-python.git
```

## Usage

Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

```
cd data-structures-and-algorithms-python
```

Run the Python script:

```
python data_structures_algorithms.py
```

Follow the menu prompts to perform various operations on the implemented data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

### 1. Array

- **Adding Data**: Add data to the array.
- **Linear Search**: Search for an element in the array sequentially.
- **Binary Search**: Search for an element in the sorted array using the binary search algorithm.
- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Radix Sort

### 2. Linked List

- **Add Data**: Add data to the linked list.
- **Remove Data**: Remove data from the linked list.

### 3. Queue

- **Enqueue**: Add data to the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove and return data from the queue.

### 4. Stack

- **Push**: Add data to the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return data from the stack.

### 5. Hash Table

- **Insert**: Insert key-value pairs into the hash table.
- **Get**: Retrieve a value associated with a given key.
- **Delete**: Remove a key-value pair from the hash table.

### 6. Graph

- **Add Edge**: Add an edge between two vertices in the graph.
- **Display**: Display the adjacency matrix representation of the graph.

## Algorithms

The script includes various algorithms such as linear search, binary search, sorting algorithms, and graph traversal algorithms.
